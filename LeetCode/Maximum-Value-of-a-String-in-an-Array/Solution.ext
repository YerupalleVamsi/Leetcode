Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".
